# Machine Learning Workshop for UT Astronomy's REU Program!

Setup Instructions: 
1. Download the GaiaREU-ML_v2024.ipynb notebook from github

2. From your local computer, open a terminal and issue the following commands, one per line:
```
python -m venv REUMLENV
source REUMLENV/bin/activate
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn yellowbrick jupyter
jupyter notebook
```
The first line creates a virtual Python environment that we will work from, as not to disturb your local Python environment. 
The second line activates this environment for use. 
The third line install the packages necessary for today's workshop. 

3. From the Jupyter environment just created, open the notebook you downloaded in step 1.

4. When we are finished, you may close Jupyter like normal, and type the following in the terminal window to close your virtual Python environment:
```
deactivate
```
